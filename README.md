# Cosign-Gatekeeper-SupplyChain-Engine

Ensure only policy-compliant, cryptographically verified container images run on AKS.

## Example synopsis

A release request binds an image digest to keyless signing evidence and an admission policy plan that rejects unsigned or unapproved artifacts before AKS execution.

## Real-world scenario

A compromised registry credential could let an attacker replace a trusted image tag. Digest signatures and admission enforcement make provenance verifiable at deployment time rather than assuming the registry alone is sufficient.

## Architecture

GitHub Actions builds and scans images, generates an SBOM and provenance, signs with Cosign using ephemeral identity, and pushes to ACR. Gatekeeper admission policies require trusted issuer, identity, digest, and approved exceptions.

Primary services: `AKS`, `ACR`, `Gatekeeper`, `Cosign`, `GitHub Actions`.

This repository implements the first production-oriented vertical slice: a
fail-closed, adapter-neutral control plane that validates tenant scope,
freshness, approvals, secretless identity, private access, and the exact
project action before producing a deterministic execution plan. Azure adapters
consume that plan; they are deliberately outside the local simulator so local
tests cannot claim a live cloud change occurred.

## Quickstart

Requirements: Python 3.11+ and Git. No Azure credentials are required.

```bash
./scripts/validate.sh
python3 src/control_plane.py --request examples/approved-request.json
```

The command emits canonical JSON with a stable idempotency key. The denied
fixture exits with status 2 and explains the failed invariants.

## Security boundaries

- Managed identity or workload identity only; embedded credentials are denied.
- Public network access and stale evidence are denied.
- Production and break-glass targets require explicit approval.
- The IaC entry point is opt-in and defaults to deploying nothing.
- Evidence output contains identifiers and decisions, never credential values.

## Verification and limitations

Local validation covers 13 tests, deterministic replay, JSON parsing, Python
compilation, ignore hygiene, and Bicep compilation when a compiler is present.
It does **not** prove Azure deployment, service licensing, quota, data-plane
permissions, provider/API availability, cloud failover, load, cost, or teardown.
